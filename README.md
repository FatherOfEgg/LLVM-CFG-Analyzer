This is an Honors project for my CSE 3150 class. It is a very simple and potentially naive CFG analyzer for LLVM IR files.

Features
--------

- Finding the longest function call chain
- Finding the longest execution path


Building
-------------------

Make sure you have clang and LLVM installed. Then to build, all you need to do is run:

    make

Same thing for the test files.
